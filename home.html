    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Did you know that humans have been milking cows for more than 8,000 years?
      Despite significant technological advancements in dairy processing and storage, the milking procedure still faces
      challenges such as being cumbersome, labor-intensive, and resource-inefficient. Outdated practices, inconsistent
      processes, and human errors can lead to lower milk production, inferior milk quality, and increased animal
      disease rates.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      At RoBovine, we are on a mission to improve the welfare of dairy farm owners, workers, and animals by
      revolutionizing the milking process. Our vision is to create a dairy cow milking system that is not only highly
      efficient but also prioritizes cow comfort, worker safety, and environmental sustainability.
    </p>
